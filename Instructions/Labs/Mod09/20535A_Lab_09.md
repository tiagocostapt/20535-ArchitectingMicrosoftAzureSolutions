## Exercise 1: Deploy Key Vault Resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure Portal

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com).

1. If this is your first time logging in to the Azure portal, you will see a dialog with a tour of the portal. Click Get Started.

#### Task 2: Deploy Key Vault

1. Create a new **Key Vault** with the following details:

    - Name: Any globally unique name. Record the name as you will need to reference it later in the lab.

    - New Resource Group: MOD09KVST

    - Location: East US

1. Wait for the creation task to complete before moving on with this lab.

#### Task 3: Add a Secret to the Key Vault using the Portal

1. Access the **Key Vault** you recently created.

1. Create a **Secret** with the following details:

    - Upload options: Manual

    - Name: thirdPartyKey

    - Value: 56d95961e597ed0f04b76e58

1. Wait for the secret creation task to complete before moving on with this lab.

#### Task 4: Add a Secret to the Key Vault using the CLI

1. Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance.

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt query a list of sercets in your key vault:

    ```
    az keyvault secret list --vault-name [name of vault]
    ```

    Make sure you replace the **[name of vault]** placeholder with the actual name of your **Key Vault** instance. For example, if the name of your instance is **examplekeyvault**, your command will look like this:  

    ```
    az keyvault secret list --vault-name examplekeyvault
    ```

1. Download a secret as a text file saved on your clouddrive instance:

    ```
    az keyvault secret download --vault-name [name of vault] --file clouddrive/secret.txt --name thirdPartyKey
    ```

    Make sure you replace the **[name of vault]** placeholder with the actual name of your **Key Vault** instance. For example, if the name of your instance is **examplekeyvault**, your command will look like this:  

    ```
    az keyvault secret download --vault-name examplekeyvault --file clouddrive/secret.txt --name thirdPartyKey
    ```

1. View the contents of the saved file:

    ```
    cat clouddrive/secret.txt
    ```

1. Create a new secret in your key vault:

    ```
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name [name of vault] --name firstPartyKey --value 56f8a55119845511c81de488
    ```

    Make sure you replace the **[name of vault]** placeholder with the actual name of your **Key Vault** instance. For example, if the name of your instance is **examplekeyvault**, your command will look like this:  

    ```
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name examplekeyvault --name firstPartyKey --value 56f8a55119845511c81de488
    ```

1. Query a list of sercets in your key vault:

    ```
    az keyvault secret list --vault-name [name of vault] --query "[*].{Id:id,Created:attributes.created}" --out table
    ```

    Make sure you replace the **[name of vault]** placeholder with the actual name of your **Key Vault** instance. For example, if the name of your instance is **examplekeyvault**, your command will look like this:  

    ```
    az keyvault secret list --vault-name examplekeyvault --query "[*].{Id:id,Created:attributes.created}" --out table
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 5: Add a Secret to the Key Vault using ARM

1. Create a new **Template deployment** with the following details:

    - Custom Deployment: type in the following:

    ```
    {
        "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "vaultName": {

                "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets",
                "name": "[concat(parameters('vaultName'), '/', variables('secretName'))]",
                "properties": {
                    "contentType": "text/plain",
                    "value": "StudentPa$$w.rd"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    - Resource Group: MOD09KVST

    - Vault Name: the name of the **Key Vault** instance you recorded earlier in the lab

1. Create another **Template deployment** with the following details:

    - Custom Deployment: type in the following:

    ```
    {
        "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "vaultName": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "variables": {
            "secretName": "storageConnectionString",
            "storageName": "[concat('stor', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
        },
        "resources": [
            {
                "apiVersion": "2017-10-01",
                "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
                "name": "[variables('storageName')]",
                "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
                "kind": "Storage",
                "sku": {
                    "name": "Standard_LRS"
                },
                "properties": {                
                }
            },
            {
                "apiVersion": "2015-06-01",
                "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets",
                "name": "[concat(parameters('vaultName'), '/', variables('secretName'))]",
                "dependsOn": [
                    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageName'))]"
                ],
                "properties": {
                    "contentType": "text/plain",
                    "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageName'), ';', 'AccountKey=', listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageName')), providers('Microsoft.Storage', 'storageAccounts').apiVersions[0]).keys[0].value, ';')]"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    - Resource Group: MOD09KVST

    - Vault Name: the name of the **Key Vault** instance you recorded earlier in the lab

1. Wait for the creation task to complete before moving on with this lab.

#### Task 6: View Key Vault Secrets

1. Access the **Key Vault** you recently created.

1.  In the **Secrets** pane, access the **storageConnectionString** secret.

1. Observe the **CURRENT VERSION** of the sercet.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you created a **Key Vault** instance and used various methods to add keys to the key vault.

## Exercise 2: Deploy Virtual Machine using Key Vault Secret

#### Task 1: Retrive your Key Vault Resource Id

1. Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance.

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt , query for the resource id of your **Key Vault**:

    ```
    az keyvault list --query [*].[id] --out tsv
    ```

1. Record the output value from the command.

#### Task 2: Edit the VM Parameters File

1. Open **vaultvm.parameters.json** found in **Allfiles (F):\\Mod09\\Labfiles\\Starter** with *Visual Studio Code*.

1. Locate the following string in your ARM template JSON content:

    ```
    /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>
    ```

1. Replace that exact string with the **resource id** you copied earlier in this lab for your **Key Vault** instance.

    For example, if your **subscription id** is **6e97419f-3274-aca4-6ba6-eea795fdff51**, your **resource group** is **MOD09KVST** and your **vault name** is **examplekeyvault**, your **resource id** would look like this:

    ```
    /subscriptions/6e97419f-3274-aca4-6ba6-eea795fdff51/resourceGroups/MOD09KVST/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/examplekeyvault
    ```

    Your final ARM parameter file would look like this:

    ```
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "password": {
                "reference": {
                    "keyVault": {
                        "id": "/subscriptions/6e97419f-3274-aca4-6ba6-eea795fdff51/resourceGroups/MOD09KVST/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/examplekeyvault"
                    },
                    "secretName": "vmPassword"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Save the file and return to **Azure Portal**,

#### Task 3: Upload the ARM Template and Parameters Files

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, query the list of external shares mounted in your bash shell:

    ```
    df --type=cifs
    ```

1. The result of the query should be a single file share that is *Mounted on* the **/usr/** directory. The name of the file share should be in the following format:

    ```
    //<storage account name>.file.core.windows.net/shell
    ```

1. Record the name of the **Storage account** associated with the file share.

    For example, if the storage account's name is **cseast123**, the file share name would be **//cseast123.file.core.windows.net/shell**

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt

1. Access the **Storage account** instance you created earlier in the lab.

1. Access the only **File share** within the storage account.

1. **Upload** two files, both located in the **Allfiles (F):\\Mod09\\Labfiles\\Starter** folder:

    - vaultvm.json

    - vaultvm.parameters.json

#### Task 4: Configure Key Vault for ARM Template Deployment

1. Access the **Key Vault** you recently created.

1. Update **Access policies** to **Enable access to Azure Resource Manager for template deployment** under advance policies.

1. Save and wait for the update operation to complete before moving on with the lab.

#### Task 5: Deploy a Linux Virtual Machine using a Key Vault Secret for the Password.

1. Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance.

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1. Deploy the ARM template with the specified parameters file:

    ```
    az group deployment create --resource-group MOD09KVST --template-file clouddrive/vaultvm.json --parameters @clouddrive/vaultvm.parameters.json
    ```

1. Wait for the creation task to complete before moving on with this lab.

## Exercise 3: Cleanup Subscription

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete Resource Groups

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to delete the **MOD09KVST** *Resource Group*:

    ```
    az group delete --name MOD09KVST --no-wait --yes
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close Active Applications

1. Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you "cleaned up your subscription" by removing the **Resource Groups** used in this lab.
