# Module 4: Creating Managed Server Applications in Azure

# Lab Answer Key: Deploying Managed Server Workloads to Azure

## Before we start

1. Ensure that you are logged in to your **Windows 10** Virtual Machine using the following credentials:

    - **Username**: Admin

    - **Password**: Pa55w.rd

1. Observe the **Taskbar** located at the bottom of your **Windows 10** desktop. The Taskbar contains the icons for the common applications we will use in the labs:

    - Microsoft Edge

    - File Explorer

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    - [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)

    - Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

    - Windows PowerShell

    - Microsoft Word 2016

    > **Note**: You can also find shortcuts to these applications on the **Desktop** and in the **Start Menu**.

## Exercise 1: Create Azure Container Service (ACS) Cluster

#### Task 1: Open the Azure Portal

1. On the Taskbar, click the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the open browser window, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1. Enter the **email address** of your *Microsoft account*.

1. Click the **Next** button.

1. Enter the **password** for your *Microsoft account*.

1. Click the **Sign in** button.

#### Task 2: Create Docker Swarm ACS Cluster using Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to create a new **Resource Group**:

    ```
    az group create --name MOD04ACSC --location eastus
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to create a new Docker Swarm cluster with a single agent and automatically generated *SSH keys*:

    ```
    az acs create --name DockerSwarmCluster --orchestrator-type Swarm --resource-group MOD04ACSC --agent-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

1. Wait for the ACS creation operation to complete.

    > **Note**: This operation can take up to five minutes.


#### Task 3: Configure Tunnel Connection to ACS Cluster using SSH

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to get a list of **Public IP Addresses** in your **Resource Group** that contain the term **master** in their name:

    ```
    az network public-ip list --resource-group MOD04ACSC --query "[?contains(name, 'master')].{Name:name,IPAddress:ipAddress}" -o table
    ```

1. The results of the query will look like this:

    ```
    Name                                                      IPAddress
    --------------------------------------------------------  ------------
    swarm-master-ip-dockerswar-mod04acsc-e91967mgmt-1FE2477D  52.170.19.88
    ```

1. Record the value of the **IPAddress** field in the query results. This is the *IP Address* of your *Docker Swarm* **master**.

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to get a list of **Public IP Addresses** in your **Resource Group** that contain the term **agent** in their name: 

    ```
    az network public-ip list --resource-group MOD04ACSC --query "[?contains(name, 'agent')].{Name:name,IPAddress:ipAddress}" -o table
    ```

1. The results of the query will look like this:

    ```
    Name                                                      IPAddress
    --------------------------------------------------------  ------------
    swarm-agent-ip-dockerswar-mod04acsc-e91967agent-1FE2477D  52.170.22.39
    ```

1. Record the value of the **IPAddress** field in the query results. This is the *IP Address* of your *Docker Swarm* **agent pool**.

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to create a SSH tunnel connection to the Docker Swarm **master** using the *IP Address* you recorded earlier:

    ```
    ssh -p 2200 -fNL 2375:localhost:2375 azureuser@[Master IP Address]
    ```

    Make sure you replace the **[Master IP Address]** placeholder with the actual IP Address of the Docker Swarm master. For example, if your master IP Address is **52.170.19.88**, your command will look like this:

    ```
    ssh -p 2200 -fNL 2375:localhost:2375 azureuser@52.170.19.88
    ```

1. You will see a prompt indicating that the authenticity of the host can't be established. Type in **yes** and press **Enter** to continue connecting.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you created a new Docker Swarm cluster and connected to that cluster using a SSH tunnel.

## Exercise 2: Deploy Docker Image to Azure Container Service (ACS) Cluster

#### Task 1: Deploy a Basic Docker Image to ACS using Tunnel Connection

1. Still within the Cloud Shell, type in the following command and press **Enter** to set an environment variable to make it easier to run *docker* commands:

    ```
    export DOCKER_HOST=:2375
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to validate that docker commands work with your Docker Swarm cluster:

    ```
    docker info
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to run the **nginx** web server in a container within your Docker Swarm cluster:

    ```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx
    ```

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to the **agent pool* *IP address* you copied earlier in this lab.

1. Observe the nginx web server placeholder webpage.

1. Close the additional browser tab and return to the browser tab with the **Azure Portal** currently active.

1. Returning to the Cloud Shell, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all running containers:

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to stop the **webserver** container:

    ```
    docker stop webserver
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to remove the **webserver** container:

    ```
    docker rm webserver
    ```

1. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all running containers:

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you deployed a Docker image (**nginx**) to the Azure Container Services' hosted Docker Swarm.

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to the IP address you copied in the previous step.

1. Observe the home page of the running Node.js web application.

1. Close the additional browser tab and return to the browser tab with the **Azure Portal** currently active.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you used an **Azure Container Instance** to deploy a single Docker container.

## Exercise 4: Cleanup Subscription

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups in the subscription:
